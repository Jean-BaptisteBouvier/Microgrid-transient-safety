# Microgrid-transient-safety

This repository contains the codes written during my internship at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in 2021.
This work was presented at the 2022 American Control Conference [Distributed Transient Safety Verification via Robust Control Invariant Sets: A Microgrid Application](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9867323). The extended version of our work is available on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09320).

The calculations and optimizations are solved on Julia for efficiency, while the figures are realized on MATLAB.
